# Overview

Two parts of a particular development or an automation scenerio:

1. The logic or ```algortithms```
2. The ```data```

These need to be organized in such a way that makes a program performant.

The different rules by which data can be organized is called Data Structural Representations, or Datastructural Rules.

Abstract data types organize the data in memory.

## Introduction

### Two types of Data Structures:

#### Primative

Data types that a program gives you to implement data

eg. int, float, char, bool, etc...

#### Non-Primative

##### Linear

###### Static

eg. Array

###### Dynamic

eg. Linked List, Stack, Queue

##### Non-Linear

eg. Trees, Graphs

## Core Concepts p1

### Algorithm

A step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.

Always demands an appropriate Data Structure.

- A problem solving procedure
- Step-by-step; time-bound; simple statements
- operates on collection of data with definite beginning, definite end, and finite steps.
- Performs operations efficiently with minimal wastage.

#### Make a cup of tea

1. Decide that tea needs to be made
2. Get ingredients
3. Boil water
4. Pour boiled water into cup
5. Add ingredients into cup
6. Enjoy tea

#### Multiply two numbers

1. Start the process
2. Get required inputs
3. Perform operation
4. Display the output
5. Stop the process

### Data Structure

The storage and organization of data.

Has the implementation of the algorithm.

We can organize our data in the way we want, and these different ways of organizing data are the different data structures.

Programmers decide which data structures to use based on the nature of the data and the operations that need to be performed

Proper structures increase the efficiency of a program.

#### Organizing books

- Could arrange on shelf
- Could arrange on table
- Could leave randomly around room

## Core Concepts p2

### Abstract Data Types

Represents the collection of data and set or operations performed on the data.

It is a data type where only behavior is defined, not the implementation.

Implementation includes choosing a particular data structure and ADT

### Advantages of Data Structures

#### Efficiency

Implementing the correct data structure and algorithm

#### Reusability

Multiple data structure access

#### Abstraction

Hiding implementation details of the data structure

### Common Operations

- Insertion
- Modification
- Deletion
- Searching
- Sorting
- Merging
- Traversals
