# Introduction

There are usually many solutions to a problem, but it is best to use the best solution.

This means to pick the right algorithm and data structure for the problem at hand.

Algorighms are measured in terms of efficiency by calculating the time complexity and space complexity

## Time Complexity

Can be measured in 3 ways:

- Best case
    - Least amount of time to complete an algorithm
- Average case
    - Average amount of time to complete an algorithm
- Worst case
    - Maximum amount of time to complete an algorithm

## Space Complexity

Largely dependant on the kind of data and data structure implementations we use.

Every variable or identifier has a memory footprint and we need to minimize space used.

Can be measured in 3 ways:

- Best case
    - Least amount of space used to complete an algorithm
- Average case
    - Average amount of space used to complete an algorithm
- Worst case
    - Maximum amount of space to used complete an algorithm
